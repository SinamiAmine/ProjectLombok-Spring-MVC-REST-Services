# ProjectLombok-Spring-MVC-REST-Services

=> REST Api
# Rest is a way of providing web services

    * HTTP Protocol
	 
	* HTTP Request Methods
	    # Get : is a request for a ressource (html file,javascript file,image ...)
		# Get : is used when you visit a website
		# HEAD : is like GET, but only asks for meta information , without body
		# Post : is used to post data to the server
		     . Typical use case for post form data to the server ( like checkout form)
	    # Put : is a request for the enclosed entity be stored at the supplied URI , if the entity exost , it is expected to be updated
		# Post is a create request
		# Put : is a create OR update request
		# Delete : is a request to delete the specified resource
		# Trace :  will echo the received request , can be used to see if request waw altered by intermediate servers
		# Options : returns the HTTP methods supported by the serve
		# Connect : convert the request to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel, Typicaly for HTTPS through an unencrypted HTTP proxy
		# Patch : Applies partial modifications to the specified resource
		# Safe Methods : are considered safe to use because they only fetch information and do not cause changes on the server ( Get,Head,Options and trace)

	* HTTP Status Codes
	    # 100 series are informational in nature
		# 200 series indicate successful request
		# 300 series are redirections
		# 400 series are client errors
		# 500 series are server side errors
	* Common HTTP Status Codes
	    # 300 okay;201 Created; 204 Accepted
		# 301 Moved permanetly
		# 400 Bad Request;401 Not Authorized; 404 Not Found
		# 500 Internal Server Error;503 Service Unavailable
	* Rest APIs use httl to create , manage ,delete server resources


=> Project Lombok
* Project Lombok Features
    # Project Lombok provides annotations which help eliminate the writing of ceremonial code
    # @Getter , @ Setter
    # Using Project Lombok will save you time and give cleaner code
    # val - declares final local variable
    # var - declares mutable local variable
    # @EqualAndHashCode
           . generates implementations of equals (Obkect other) and hashCode()
           . By default will use non-static,non-transient properties
           . Can optionally exclude specific properties
    # Data : . Generates Combines of @Getter @Setters @ToString @EqualHashCode @RequredArgsConstructor
    # @Syncronized and @SneakyThrows
    # @Log
    # @Slf4j : Recomended , the default spring oot logger is LogBack

	* How Lombok Work
	    # Hooks in via the annotaion processor API
		# Thus, Produces properly compiled java code in conjunction with the java compiler
		# NOTE : Code is enerated and compiled, no run-time performance penalty
		# if you write an implementaion of a methid project lombok would generate your code is used
		     . Make it easey to override lombok generated code
			 . Exemple : custom setters


	* Â¨Project Lombok Logging : 
	      . add annotation @Slf4j to the service or controller or anuthing want to logging
		  . Use log.debug("") 
		  . add logging.level.packagename = debug
	* De-Lombok
	      . Go to refactor --> De-Lombok
		  . Delombok is a tool for the Lombok library that generates standard Java 
		    code from annotated source code. It allows you to see the actual code that Lombok generates at compile time, which can be useful for debugging, code reviews, and understanding 
			how Lombok works. With delombok, you can produce code that is equivalent to the code that would be generated by Lombok, but without using Lombok at runtime.

=> Spring Mvc Rest Services
* HTTP Client : ( it's like postman is for testing API's)

    # Go To Tools -> HTTP CLIENT
    # Configure Uri and run it

* Using Path Paramethers

@RequestMapping(value = "/{beerId}",method = RequestMethod.GET)
public Beer getBeerById(@PathVariable("beerId") UUID beerId){
log.debug("Get Beer By Id - In The Controller");
return beerService.getBeerById(beerId);
}

=> Spring Boot Devlopment Tools
# Dependency : spring-boot-devtools

DevTools include features like automatic restarts of the application when
changes are made to the code, LiveReload support for automatically refreshing the
browser when changes are made to frontend assets, and enhanced error reporting that
includes more detailed information about the root cause of errors.

In summary, Spring Boot DevTools can help developers to speed up their development
cycle and improve the quality of their applications by providing a more streamlined
and efficient development environment.

     * set header on HttpResponse
	 
    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity handlePost(@RequestBody Beer beer){
        Beer savedBeer = beerService.saveNewBeer(beer);
        // This add a header of type key,value to return an response with header to see what wrong
        HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
        headers.add("location","/api/v1/beer/"+savedBeer.getId());
        return  new ResponseEntity(headers,HttpStatus.CREATED);
    }

	 * HTTP Patch
	    # HTTP Patch is a method in the HTTP protocol that is used to modify an existing resource on a web server.
		# With HTTP Patch, a client can send a request to a server to make partial updates to an existing resource. 
		# The HTTP Patch method is often used in RESTful web services, where a client may want to update a specific field or property of a resource without having to send the entire resource back to the server.
    Exemple :
	@PatchMapping("/{beerId}")
    public ResponseEntity updateBeerPatchById(@PathVariable("beerId") UUID beerId,@RequestBody Beer beer){
        beerService.patchBeerById(beerId,beer);
        return new ResponseEntity(HttpStatus.NO_CONTENT);
    }
	
	    @Override
    public void patchBeerById(UUID beerId, Beer beer) {
        Beer existing = beerMap.get(beerId);
        if (StringUtils.hasText(beer.getBeerName())){
            existing.setBeerName(beer.getBeerName());
        }

        if (beer.getBeerStyle() != null) {
            existing.setBeerStyle(beer.getBeerStyle());
        }

        if (beer.getPrice() != null) {
            existing.setPrice(beer.getPrice());
        }

        if (beer.getQuantityOnHand() != null){
            existing.setQuantityOnHand(beer.getQuantityOnHand());
        }

        if (StringUtils.hasText(beer.getUpc())) {
            existing.setUpc(beer.getUpc());
        }
    }



1. [@Controller and @RestController are both annotations in the Spring Framework that are used to create web controllers in a Spring-based web application. ] 

The main difference between the two annotations is the type of response that they generate:

        # @Controller is a general-purpose annotation that is used to create controllers that handle web requests and return an HTML view or perform other server-side processing. A method in a @Controller can return a string representing the name of the view to be rendered, or a ModelAndView object that includes the view name and model data.
        # @RestController is a specialized version of @Controller that is used to create controllers that handle RESTful web services. A method in a @RestController returns data that is written directly to the HTTP response body, rather than being rendered into an HTML view. The data is typically returned in a structured format such as JSON or XML.	

NB )  Jackson is the default library used by Spring to convert Java objects into JSON
